🚦 SafeZone – Road Risk Awareness System

SafeZone is a web-based road safety application designed to help drivers and authorities identify and understand high-risk road zones in advance. The system focuses on prevention rather than reaction, aiming to improve safety through timely awareness and clear guidance.

🌟 Project Purpose

Road accidents often occur at specific locations such as sharp curves, poorly lit roads, and high-traffic intersections. Many existing systems respond after an incident occurs.

SafeZone aims to support safer travel by:

Detecting nearby risk-prone road zones

Providing early visual and voice alerts

Offering clear explanations and safety suggestions

Assisting authorities with risk monitoring and insights

🛠️ What the Project Does

Shows the user’s current location on a map

Highlights nearby road risk zones

Calculates a risk score based on road features and context

Displays easy-to-understand safety alerts

Provides voice alerts for hands-free driving

Includes an authority dashboard for monitoring risk trends

🧠 About the Intelligence Used

The system uses AI-assisted, rule-based reasoning to analyze multiple factors such as:

Road characteristics

Proximity to risk zones

Current speed and context

This approach allows the system to generate explainable and understandable insights.
Generative AI can be integrated in future versions if needed.
